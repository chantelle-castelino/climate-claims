# Evaluating the claim CO2-induced green lands cause land surface temperature cooling
<br>
The article written by Kenneth Richard makes the claim that new studies have been showing that warming and CO2 fertilization have actually been leading to the cooling of land surface temperatures (Richard, 2021). This piece begins by highlighting journal articles that were previously discussed by the same author. These studies all point a similar idea, that ‘global greening’ has actually been cooling the surface of the Earth. The consensus that is reached from these articles is that the CO2 released anthropogenically is actually beneficial to the planet as it nourishes plants. This extra nourishment is referred to as CO2 fertilization and is said to increase land greening and the Leaf Area Index (LAI; a measure that quantifies plant canopies). Furthermore, a claim is made that CO2 fertilization is increasing the carbon sinks present on Earth. Initially, these all seem like positive claims, which makes the reader believe that anthropogenic CO2 emissions might actually be positive. This article is of particular interest as it goes against one of the most widely accepted claims regarding climate change: the release of anthropogenic CO2 is one of the primary factors driving the rise of global temperatures. This article is effective in delivering its message, as most people have learned in high school that plants absorb CO2 and release oxygen. In theory, then, it is not unfathomable that greater CO2 emissions may lead to better plant health and a higher LAI. The author concludes this article with sensible advice (i.e., planting trees is better for the climate than cutting down forests). Overall, it makes the reader believe that they do not contribute to climate change and might in fact be helping with their CO2 emissions.
